> ⚠️ Now compatible only with Nova 10.x+

This package provides basic syntax highlighting for PostCSS. For now focusing mainly to achieve the best possible experience in pair with TailwindCSS. If your eyes are bleeding because of the lack of support for apply or tailwind directives, this plugin is for you! The package is based on the default Nova syntax definitions and supplemented with elements known for PostCSS / Tailwind. This plugin supports rules nesting as well.
