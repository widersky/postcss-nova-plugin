# PostCSS Syntax highlighting

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/widersky/postcss-nova-plugin/main/Images/screenshot.png" alt="PostCSS for Nova" />

This package provides basic syntax highlighting for PostCSS. For now focusing mainly to achieve the best possible experience in pair with TailwindCSS. If your eyes are bleeding because of the lack of support for apply or tailwind directives, this plugin is for you! The package is based on the default SCSS syntax definition and supplemented with elements known for PostCSS / Tailwind. This plugin supports rules nesting as well.

## Having issues?

> [Please let me know](https://github.com/widersky/postcss-nova-plugin/issues) if there are any issues or something is not ok. I will do my best to make sure the plugin is the best quality possible!

## Plans for further development

* Clean current syntax definition
* Add new features
